Python script to track time / hours. 

## Getting Started

I have this set up through an alias to run in my terminal:

```
alias hours="python ~/Dropbox/Shell\ Scripts/hours.py"
```

Time can be entered with "am" or "a" for short; the same for "pm" or "p".

Lunch is assumed to be known and is entered as a measure of hours: 1 (1h) 0.75 (45 min), 0.5 (30 min), 0.25 (15 min) ... etc. A precise amount would work as well (0.88) etc.
